# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started a new react-native challenge, using the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/). 

**Thoughts:** My first time trying Typescript, struggled a little trying to figure out how it works.

### Day 2: February 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started to style my app with styled-components and to program the search bar - which is still not working.

**Thoughts**: Tried to switch back to javascript, but it woudn't work. For a while I thought my project would never work again. Fortunately, it did. But I'm still struggling with Typescript.

### Day 3: February 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Fixed some bugs on the Movie App, but got stuck on some type errors. Tomorrow I will try to fix what's wrong on my configs so I can start over with just Javascript and move on to another project.

**Thoughts**: I'm not ready for typescript, but now my computer won't run any react native without it.
