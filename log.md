# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started a new react-native challenge, using the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/). 

**Thoughts:** My first time trying Typescript, struggled a little trying to figure out how it works.

### Day 2: February 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started to style my app with styled-components and to program the search bar - which is still not working.

**Thoughts**: Tried to switch back to javascript, but it woudn't work. For a while I thought my project would never work again. Fortunately, it did. But I'm still struggling with Typescript.
