# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started a new react-native challenge, using the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/). 

**Thoughts:** My first time trying Typescript, struggled a little trying to figure out how it works.

### Day 2: February 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started to style my app with styled-components and to program the search bar - which is still not working.

**Thoughts**: Tried to switch back to javascript, but it woudn't work. For a while I thought my project would never work again. Fortunately, it did. But I'm still struggling with Typescript.

### Day 3: February 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Fixed some bugs on the Movie App, but got stuck on some type errors. Tomorrow I will try to fix what's wrong on my configs so I can start over with just Javascript and move on to another project.

**Thoughts**: I'm not ready for typescript, but now my computer won't run any react native without it.

### Day 4: February 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Could't find what's not letting me run react-native apps. But I started a fun new project: the Love Calculator. I'm not using any API, just calculating the love percentage based on the number of letters and whether this number is even or not.

**Thoughts**: I used react hooks and could understand 100% of what is happening

### Day 5: February 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Added images and some styles to the Love Calculator.

**Thoughts**: Still need to improve the logic behind it.
